# The Official Repository of JeffsWeb.Site

Oh yeah.

Bootstrapped using Create React App.

## How to Start It Up

I usually use `npm run start` to debug. Navigate your browser to http://localhost:3000/ and the site should launch, and even reload while you edit and recompile.

## Deploying

I deploy it using `npm run build` to create a static production build, and then I deploy the build folder out to my host.

For backend stuff, I'm attempting to use Heroku as a host. I've got Heroku automatically building off of Master, but if you'd like to host it locally, I've just been running a gradle bootRun in eclipse.
